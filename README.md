Clean Architecture is a software design pattern that emphasizes separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability. It helps create systems that are flexible, scalable, and easy to change without breaking other parts of the application. In a .NET Core 6 application, this design pattern can be applied by organizing the code into layers, each with its own responsibility. Here’s a simple breakdown of how it works:

**Layers of Clean Architecture**
Clean Architecture typically consists of the following layers:

Entities (Core Layer)
Use Cases / Application Logic (Application Layer)
Interface Adapters (Infrastructure Layer)
Frameworks & Drivers (UI Layer)
Each layer depends only on the layers inside it, and never on the layers outside. This ensures that business logic and core functionalities are isolated from external technologies.

**Layers in Detail:**

**1. Entities Layer (Core Layer)**
What it is: This is the most central part of the architecture and contains the business logic and domain entities. These are the fundamental parts of your application.
Example: In an e-commerce app, entities would include Order, Customer, and Product.
No Dependencies: This layer doesn’t depend on any other layer. It doesn’t care about databases, APIs, or UI—it just knows about the business rules.

**2. Application Layer (Use Cases)**
What it is: This layer contains application-specific business logic or use cases. It manages application flow and defines how data is created, modified, and retrieved.
Example: Use cases like "Place an order", "Cancel an order", or "Generate a sales report".
Dependency on Core Layer: It can depend on the core layer but should not depend on frameworks, databases, or external interfaces.
**3. Infrastructure Layer (Interface Adapters)**
What it is: This layer acts as a bridge between the core logic and external systems like databases, APIs, or file storage. This layer contains repositories and services that connect the application to the outside world.
Example: A repository that implements methods to access a SQL Server database or a service that interacts with an external API.
Dependency on Application Layer: It can depend on the application layer, but it should not contain business rules. It handles database connections, logging, third-party services, etc.

**4. Presentation Layer (Frameworks & Drivers / UI Layer)**
What it is: This is the outermost layer where controllers or UI components live. It can include your ASP.NET Core controllers, API endpoints, or Angular/React components.
Example: A REST API controller in .NET Core that accepts HTTP requests and passes them to the application layer to handle business logic.
Dependency on Infrastructure Layer: It can depend on the infrastructure layer to send or receive data from external systems.
**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
In Clean Architecture, higher-level layers like Entities and Use Cases should not directly depend on lower-level layers (like Infrastructure). Instead, we use interfaces to invert the dependency.

**For example:**

The Application Layer doesn't directly know about the database. Instead, it talks to an interface (e.g., IEmployeeRepository), and the Infrastructure Layer implements that interface.
This way, you can easily swap out databases or external services without changing the core logic.

**Benefits of Clean Architecture**
**Testability:** Each layer is isolated, so you can easily test business logic without worrying about the database or UI.

**Maintainability:** Changes to one layer (e.g., switching from SQL Server to MongoDB) don’t affect other layers.

**Flexibility:** You can replace external systems, UI, or infrastructure without changing core business logic.
